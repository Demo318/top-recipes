    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The aroma alone is a symphony of savory spices and rich, golden crust, 
      promising a bite that delivers an initial shattering crunch giving way 
      to impossibly juicy, tender meat within. Each piece is a perfect balance
      of crispy exterior and succulent interior, seasoned to a harmonious
      perfection that lingers delightfully on the palate long after the last
      satisfying morsel. This isn't just fried chicken; it's an experience, a
      testament to simple ingredients elevated to an art form.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
      <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, 
        paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the 
        milk and egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees 
        C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry 
        ingredients until evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the 
        chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with
        a slotted spatula, and serve.
