    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Picture rings of sweet, perfectly sliced onion, each one encased in a
      light yet incredibly crisp batter that shatters with the slightest
      pressure, releasing a burst of subtly sweet and savory flavor. There's no
      greasy residue, only a clean, satisfying crunch giving way to the tender,
      yielding onion within. Seasoned just so, with a whisper of spice that
      enhances without overpowering, these aren't mere side items; they are
      golden, addictive halos of fried perfection, leaving you craving just one
      more.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup chilled club soda</li>
      <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 large onions, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices and separated into rings</li>
      <li>fine salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, cornstarch, potato flakes, and cayenne pepper in a
        large bowl. Whisk in club soda to make a smooth batter. Place bread
        crumbs in a shallow pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, dip onion rings into batter, then press in bread
        crumbs to coat.
      </li>
      <li>Cook coated onion rings, a few at a time, in hot oil until golden
        brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack set over paper towels
        to drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with fine salt and serve hot.
